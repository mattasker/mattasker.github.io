I presented a poster on our recent pre-print ["Fixation and extinction in time-fluctuating spatially structured metapopulations"](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2504.08433) at [ESBS 2025](https://www.esbs2025.physik.uni-muenchen.de/) in Munich, Germany. It was a great conference and a lot of fun. Happy birthday Erwin!
