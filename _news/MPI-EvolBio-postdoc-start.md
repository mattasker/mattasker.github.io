I have started as a postdoctoral researcher in the [Theoretical Biology group](https://theobio.evolbio.mpg.de/#home) at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Biology working with Arne Traulsen. I will be investigating stress-induced mutagenesis on a [HFSP funded project](https://www.hfsp.org/sites/default/files/195x265_Grant%20Award%20Booklet_2024_7.pdf) working in collaboration with experimentalists in the Martin Kupiec lab at Tel Aviv University.
