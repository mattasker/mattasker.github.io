From 9th-12th July we hosted the Leeds 2024 Eco-Evolutionary Dynamics (L24EEDs) workshop on the broad topic: “Mathematical modelling of microbial communities: cooperation, dynamics, and resistance”.

This workshop brought together about 65 participants from across the globe, coming from a variety of communities (maths, biology, ecology, physics and computing) delivering 34 presentations. Participants fruitfully exchanged ideas about the different tools they use to address questions ranging from fundamental issues on the role of fluctuations in evolutionary processes to the modelling of antibiotic resistance, and the evolution of cooperative behaviour.

The event was sponsored by the [UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council](https://www.ukri.org/councils/epsrc/), as part of an EPSRC/NSF collaboration, and by the [Leeds School of Mathematics](https://eps.leeds.ac.uk/maths).
