The group recently attended the IoP Physics of Life 2025 conference in sunny Harrogate and had a great time.

There were several interesting talks and discussions, particularly one from [Cameron Boggon](https://ch.linkedin.com/in/cameron-boggon-3a0007164) at ETH Zurich regarding spatial structure in microbial communities and methods of probing its effects experimentally. Cells in the experimental setup he showed could really be set up in well-defined spatial structures on a single-cell level. I also enjoyed particularly exciting talks from [Paula García-Galindo](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=XOfzl6wAAAAJ&hl=en) regarding the genotype-phenotype map and RNA plasticity emerging from a response to fluctuating environemnts and [Nathalie Balaban](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=NcV19fEAAAAJ&hl=en) regarding statistical physics aprroaches to bacteria under strong perturbations, using techniques from random network dynamics to model systems which have been strongly perturbed.

Furthermore, there were two excellent poster sessions, one of which myself and [Dr. Lluís Hernández-Navarro](https://scholar.google.es/citations?user=MTPKujEAAAAJ&hl=en) were happy to be a part of. In particular, Lluís' poster titled ["Slow spatial migration can help eradicate cooperative antimicrobial resistance in time-varying environments"](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iuc8wyc_M25fqd5qmYmTOOhWXKrnW64E/view?usp=drive_link) won a prize for best poster!

Additionally, see my poster below:
