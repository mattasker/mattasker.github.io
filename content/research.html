<p>
  My work explores how populations respond to changing environments. Using mathematical models and computer simulations, I study how ecological and evolutionary forces interact to shape population adaptation. In particular, many of the models I work on are inspired by microbial communities.

<h3>Stress-induced mutagenesis</h3>
<h5>In collaboration with Octavio Calvo, Jessica Gosse, Martin Kupiec, and Arne Traulsen.</h5>
<p>
  Some organisms respond to stress by upregulating mutational mechanisms, behaviour believed to allow for rapid adaptation during tough times. These mutations typically affect cells negatively at the individual level but on a population level they can become beneficial. This research examines how such strategies come about and evolve in populations, including how they affect survival and adaptation during periods of stress.

<h3>Evolution of spatially structured populations under time-varying environments</h3>
<h5>In collaboration with Mohamed Swailem, Uwe Täuber, and Mauro Mobilia.</h5>
  <p>
    Spatial structure is a key feature of natural microbial communities, shaping how populations evolve over time. In this project, we studied populations divided into many small subpopulations (demes), where wild-type and mutant cells interact in environments that vary in time.
  </p>
  <p>
    Using a combination of mathematical models and simulations, we explored how migration between subpopulations and environmental variability together influence whether a mutant with a selective advantage can take over or be eliminated. Our findings show that:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>In static environments, a mutant either fixes in the population or dies out, depending on its advantage and the migration rate. Generally, it is not possible to remove the mutant from the population if its selective advantage is large enough.</li>
    <li>In time-varying environments, population bottlenecks create new dynamics: weak bottlenecks produce qualitatively new behaviour, demonstrating optimal environmental switching rates for mutant fixation, while strong bottlenecks can be tuned to eliminate rare mutants without risking the survival of the overall population, even when the mutant has a large advantage.</li>
    <li>The interaction between spatial structure and environmental variability produces behaviours that cannot be predicted from non-spatial or constant-environment models.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    This work provides a framework to understand the evolutionary dynamics of real microbial communities where space and changing environments both play critical roles.

<h3>Cooperative antimicrobial resistance</h3>
<h5>In collaboration with Lluís Hernández-Navarro, Alastair Rucklidge, and Mauro Mobilia.</h5>
  <p>
    The rise of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a pressing global issue, responsible for hundreds of thousands of deaths each year, a number projected to rise dramatically by 2050 without intervention. Beyond the human cost, AMR has enormous economic implications, with losses in global production estimated at trillions of dollars.
  </p>
  <p>
    This project investigates how AMR evolves in microbial populations. Many resistant cells produce enzymes that inactivate antimicrobial drugs, but this comes at a metabolic cost, reducing their growth rate. Sensitive cells do not pay this cost but are affected by the drug. The enzyme can be either intracellular (benefitting only the resistant cell) or extracellular (benefitting nearby sensitive cells), creating a cooperative dynamic.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our study focuses on the evolution of cooperative AMR in time-varying environments, exploring how changes in resource level and antimicrobial concentration affect the competition between resistant (cooperator) and sensitive (defector) strains. In our models:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Cooperator strains pay a metabolic cost to produce an extracellular enzyme that breaks down the antimicrobial in the medium (extracellular).</li>
    <li>Defector strains benefit from the enzyme if cooperators exceed a critical threshold, without paying the metabolic cost.</li>
    <li>We investigate thresholds defined in either absolute or relative abundance, which correspond to different ecological conditions under time-varying environments.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    This work provides a framework to understand the evolution of cooperative resistance and its persistence under varying environmental conditions. Importantly, we look find parameter regimes where resistance can be eliminated with high probability, behaviour which does not occur in the static environment model. This has implications for controlling and preventing AMR in microbial communities.

 <h3>Twofold environmental variability in microbial populations</h3>
 <h5>In collaboration with Lluís Hernández-Navarro, Alastair Rucklidge, and Mauro Mobilia.</h5>
  <p>
    In natural microbial communities, environmental conditions often vary in multiple ways. In this work, we consider environmental variability that can affect both the death rates (nutrient availability or concentration of biocidal antimicrobial) and birth rates (toxin levels or biostatic antimicrobial presence).
  </p>
  <p>
    This project explores how simultaneous variations in both birth and death rates (i.e. twofold environmental variability) shape population dynamics. Using mathematical models, we investigate how this affects which species is favoured and how population sizes change over time:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>These combined variations alter the direction of selection and its strength.</li>
    <li>We analyse the population under birth-rate variability alone, showing that strong and frequent toxin/biostatic antimicrobial variations can promote long-lived coexistence between species.</li>
    <li>Adding death-rate variability (nutrient-level or biocidal antimicrobial) reveals a non-trivial interaction: stronger biostatic variations support coexistence, whereas stronger biocidal fluctuations can jeopardise it.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    This work provides insight into how complex environmental variability influences species coexistence, biodiversity, and microbial evolution -- with applications to ecology and public health, including the evolution of antimicrobial resistance.
