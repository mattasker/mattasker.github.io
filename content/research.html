<h2>Research</h2>

<p>
  My work explores how populations respond to changing environments. Using mathematical models and computer simulations, I study how ecological and evolutionary forces interact to shape the evolution and adaptation of populations, particularly in the context of microbial communities.
</p>

<h3>Stress-Induced Mutagenesis</h3>
<p>
  Organisms sometimes respond to stress by increasing their mutation rates, a mechanism believed to allow for rapid adaptation in tough times. This research examines how such strategies come about and remain in populations, as well as how they affect survival and adaptation during periods of stress.

<h3>Evolution in Spatially Structured Populations</h3>
  <p>
    Spatial structure is a key feature of natural microbial communities, shaping how populations evolve over time. In this project, we studied populations divided into many small subpopulations (demes), where wild-type and mutant cells interact in environments that fluctuate over time.
  </p>
  <p>
    Using a combination of mathematical models and simulations, we explored how migration between subpopulations and environmental variability together influence whether a mutant can take over, persist, or be eliminated. Our findings show that:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>In static environments, a mutant either fixes in the population or dies out, depending on its advantage and the migration rate.</li>
    <li>In fluctuating environments, population bottlenecks create new dynamics: weak bottlenecks can enhance the chance of mutant fixation, while strong bottlenecks can eliminate rare mutants without risking the survival of the overall population, even when the mutant has a large advantage.</li>
    <li>The interaction between spatial structure and environmental variability produces behaviours that cannot be predicted from non-spatial or constant-environment models.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    This work provides a framework to understand the evolutionary dynamics of real microbial communities where space and changing environments both play critical roles.

<h3>Cooperative Antimicrobial Resistance</h3>
  <p>
    The rise of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a pressing global issue, responsible for hundreds of thousands of deaths each year, a number projected to rise dramatically by 2050 without intervention. Beyond the human cost, AMR has enormous economic implications, with losses in global production estimated at trillions of dollars.
  </p>
  <p>
    This project investigates how AMR evolves in microbial populations. Many resistant cells produce enzymes that inactivate antimicrobial drugs, but this comes at a metabolic cost, reducing their growth rate. Sensitive cells do not pay this cost but are affected by the drug. The enzyme can be either intracellular (benefitting only the resistant cell) or extracellular (benefitting nearby sensitive cells), creating a cooperative dynamic.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our study focuses on the evolution of cooperative AMR in <strong>time-varying environments</strong>, exploring how fluctuations in resources and antimicrobial concentrations affect the competition between resistant (cooperator) and sensitive (defector) strains. In our models:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Cooperator strains pay a metabolic cost to produce an extracellular enzyme that breaks down the antimicrobial in the medium.</li>
    <li>Defector strains benefit from the enzyme if cooperators exceed a critical threshold, without paying the metabolic cost.</li>
    <li>We investigate thresholds defined in either absolute or relative abundance, which correspond to different ecological conditions under fluctuating environments.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    This work provides a framework to understand the evolution of cooperative resistance and its persistence under varying environmental conditions, where we look for (and find) parameter regimes where resistance can be eliminated with high probability. This has implications for controlling and preventing AMR in microbial communities.

 <h3>Twofold Environmental Variability in Microbial Populations</h3>
  <p>
    In natural microbial communities, environmental conditions often fluctuate in multiple ways. In the above work, we have considered environmental variability (EV) that only affects death rates, for example due to changing nutrient availability. But birth rates in these populations can also vary stochastically, for instance due to fluctuations in toxin levels or biocidal antimicrobial presence.
  </p>
  <p>
    This project explores how simultaneous fluctuations in both birth and death rates -- called <strong>twofold environmental variability</strong> -- shape population dynamics. Using mathematical models, we investigate how these dual environmental fluctuations affect which species is favoured and how population sizes change over time.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>EV affecting death rates corresponds to changes in nutrient availability, while EV affecting birth rates corresponds to changes in toxin levels or antimicrobial concentration.</li>
    <li>These combined fluctuations alter the direction of selection and its strength.</li>
    <li>We analyse the population under toxin-level variability alone, showing that strong and frequent toxin fluctuations can promote long-lived coexistence between species.</li>
    <li>Adding nutrient-level variability reveals a non-trivial interaction: stronger toxin fluctuations support coexistence, whereas stronger nutrient fluctuations can jeopardise it.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    This work provides insight into how complex environmental variability influences species coexistence, biodiversity, and microbial evolution -- with applications to ecology and public health, including the evolution of antimicrobial resistance.
