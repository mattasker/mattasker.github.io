 <h2>About</h2>
<p>Hello there! My name is Matthew Asker and I am a theoretical physicist with a strong interest in evolution. I'm currently a postdoctoral researcher in the <a href="https://theobio.evolbio.mpg.de/" target="_blank">Theoretical Biology group</a> at the <a href="https://www.evolbio.mpg.de/2169/en" target="_blank">Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Biology</a>, located in the beautiful German town of Plön (see header image). On these pages, you can find some information about me and my research.</p>
<p>I grew up in Suffolk, a green county in the east of England,
best known for farmland, Ed Sheeran, and my football team, <a href="https://www.itfc.co.uk/" target="_blank">Ipswich Town</a>. After
undergraduate studies in theoretical physics at <a
href="https://www.manchester.ac.uk/" target="_blank">Manchester</a>, I obtained my PhD
in Applied Mathematics at <a href="https://www.leeds.ac.uk/" target="_blank">Leeds</a> under the supervision of <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/mmobilia-website/home" target="_blank">Prof. Mauro Mobilia</a> and <a href="https://eps.leeds.ac.uk/maths/staff/4075/professor-alastair-m-rucklidge" target="_blank">Prof. Alastair Rucklidge</a>. During
my time in Leeds, I worked on several models of competition in populations under time-varying environments, using tools from across non-equilbrium statistical physics. My thesis can be found <a href="https://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/id/eprint/37292/" target="_blank">here</a> and the individual publications are available on <a href="#publications" target="_blank">this page</a>.</p>
<p>Since 2025, I have been working as a postdoctoral researcher with
<a href="https://www.evolbio.mpg.de/person/12087/2169" target="_blank">Prof. Arne Traulsen</a>. Here, I am working on theoretical models of stress-induced mutagenesis, investigating how stress can lead to increased mutation rates in biological systems. You can read
more about this work (soon) and my past research on <a href="#research" target="_blank">this page</a>.</p>
<p>In my free time, I enjoy running in nature, playing & watching football, and reading to combat my pathological case of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsundoku" target="_blank">tsundoku</a>. In the summer, you'll also find <a href="figures/ploen-lake-kayaking.jpg" target="_blank">me</a> taking advantage of the many beautiful lakes in Plön.</p>

    <strong>Jul 21, 2025</strong> – I have started as a postdoctoral researcher in the Theoretical Biology group at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Biology working with Arne Traulsen. I will be investigating stress-induced mutagenesis on a HFSP funded project working in collaboration with experimentalists in the Martin Kupiec lab at Tel Aviv University.

    <strong>Apr 11, 2025</strong> – A new pre-print collaborating with colleagues at Virginia Tech is out! We investigate fixation and extinction in time-fluctuating spatially structured metapopulations. Read it here: <a href="https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2504.08433" target="_blank">10.48550/arXiv.2504.08433</a>.

    <strong>Mar 27, 2025</strong> – Our group attended the IoP Physics of Life 2025 conference in Harrogate. We enjoyed several talks on microbial communities and genotype-phenotype mapping, and participated in two poster sessions. Lluís Hernández-Navarro won a prize for his poster on antimicrobial resistance, and I also presented my own poster at the event.

<li>
    <strong>Mar 04, 2025</strong> – I gave an invited talk at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Biology in Plön, Germany titled "Evolution of populations in fluctuating environments".

    <strong>Jul 11, 2024</strong> – From 9th–12th July we hosted the Leeds 2024 Eco-Evolutionary Dynamics (L24EEDs) workshop on the broad topic: “Mathematical modelling of microbial communities: cooperation, dynamics, and resistance”.  
    This workshop brought together about 65 participants from across the globe, coming from a variety of communities (maths, biology, ecology, physics and computing) delivering 34 presentations. Participants fruitfully exchanged ideas about the different tools they use to address questions ranging from fundamental issues on the role of fluctuations in evolutionary processes to the modelling of antibiotic resistance, and the evolution of cooperative behaviour.  
    The event was sponsored by the <a href="https://www.ukri.org/councils/epsrc/" target="_blank">UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council</a>, as part of an EPSRC/NSF collaboration, and by the <a href="https://eps.leeds.ac.uk/maths" target="_blank">Leeds School of Mathematics</a>.
